the a ected system (top) and how it uses a malicious version of the
pam_unix.so  le to gain access to the machine (bottom; the password that it
uses and accepts is Mtm$%889*G*S3%G)
How Skidmap drops the cryptocurrency miner
The “pc” binary checks whether the infected system’s OS is Debian or
RHEL/CentOS. Its routine, which involves dropping the cryptocurrency miner
and other components, depends on OS. For Debian-based systems, it drops
the cryptocurrency miner payload to /tmp/miner2. For CentOS/RHEL
systems, it will download a tar (tape archive)  le from the URL,
hxxp://pm[.]ipfswallet[.]tk/cos7[.]tar[.]gz, containing the cryptocurrency
miner and its multiple components, which is unpacked and then installed.
Of note is that the content of the tar  le is decrypted via OpenSSL with the
key “jcx@076” using Triple DES cipher.

Skidmap’s other malicious components
The malware has notable components that are meant to further obfuscate
its malicious activities and ensure that they continue to run:

A fake “rm” binary — One of the components contained in the tar  le is a fake “rm”
binary that will replace the original (rm is normally used as command for deleting  les).
The malicious routine of this  le sets up a malicious cron job that would download and
execute a  le. This routine won’t always be observed, however, as it would only be
performed randomly.

kaudited — A  le installed as /usr/bin/kaudited. This binary will drop and install several
loadable kernel modules (LKMs) on the infected machine. To ensure that the infected
machine won’t crash due to the kernel-mode rootkits, it uses di erent modules for
speci c kernel versions. The kaudited binary also drops a watchdog component that
will monitor the cryptocurrency miner  le and process.

netlink — This rootkit fakes the network tra c statistics (speci cally tra c involving
certain IP addresses and ports) and CPU-related statistics (hide the “pamdicks” process
and CPU load). This would make the CPU load of the infected machine always appear
low. This is likely to make it appear as if nothing is amiss to the user (as high CPU usage
is a red  ag of cryptocurrency-mining malware).

Best practices and Trend Micro solutions
Skidmap uses fairly advanced methods to ensure that it and its components
remain undetected. For instance, its use of LKM rootkits — given their
capability to overwrite or modify parts of the kernel — makes it harder to
clean compared to other malware. In addition, Skidmap has multiple ways
to access a ected machines, which allow it to reinfect systems that have
been restored or cleaned up.
Cryptocurrency-mining threats don’t just a ect a server or workstation’s
performance — they could also translate to higher expenses and even
disrupt businesses especially if they are used to run mission-critical
operations. Given Linux’s use in many enterprise environments, its users,
particularly administrators, should always adopt best practices: keep the

TLP:CLEAR 
ransomware follows the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model in which developers create, 
maintain, and update the malware, and affiliates conduct the ransomware attacks. From June 2021 
through at least November 2022, threat actors have used Hive ransomware to target a wide range of 
businesses and critical infrastructure sectors, including Government Facilities, Communications, 
Critical Manufacturing, Information Technology, and especially Healthcare and Public Health (HPH). 
The method of initial intrusion will depend on which affiliate targets the network. Hive actors have 
gained initial access to victim networks by using single factor logins via Remote Desktop Protocol 
(RDP), virtual private networks (VPNs), and other remote network connection protocols [T1133]. In 
some cases, Hive actors have bypassed multifactor authentication (MFA) and gained access to 
FortiOS servers by exploiting Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) CVE-2020-12812. This 
vulnerability enables a malicious cyber actor to log in without a prompt for the user’s second 
authentication factor (FortiToken) when the actor changes the case of the username. 
Hive actors have also gained initial access to victim networks by distributing phishing emails with 
malicious attachments [T1566.001] and by exploiting the following vulnerabilities against Microsoft 
Exchange servers [T1190]: 
•  CVE-2021-31207 - Microsoft Exchange Server Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability 
•  CVE-2021-34473 - Microsoft Exchange Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability 
•  CVE-2021-34523 - Microsoft Exchange Server Privilege Escalation Vulnerability 
After gaining access, Hive ransomware attempts to evade detention by executing processes to: 
• 
Identify processes related to backups, antivirus/anti-spyware, and file copying and then 
terminating those processes to facilitate file encryption [T1562]. 
•  Stop the volume shadow copy services and remove all existing shadow copies via vssadmin 
on command line or via PowerShell [T1059] [T1490]. 
•  Delete Windows event logs, specifically the System, Security and Application logs [T1070]. 
Prior to encryption, Hive ransomware removes virus definitions and disables all portions of Windows 
Defender and other common antivirus programs in the system registry [T1112]. 
Hive actors exfiltrate data likely using a combination of Rclone and the cloud storage service Mega.nz 
[T1537]. In addition to its capabilities against the Microsoft Windows operating system, Hive 
ransomware has known variants for Linux, VMware ESXi, and FreeBSD. 
During the encryption process, a file named *.key (previously *.key.*) is created in the root 
directory (C:\ or /root/). Required for decryption, this key file only exists on the machine where it 
was created and cannot be reproduced. The ransom note, HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt is dropped into 
each affected directory and states the *.key file cannot be modified, renamed, or deleted, otherwise 
the encrypted files cannot be recovered [T1486]. The ransom note contains a “sales department” 
.onion link accessible through a TOR browser, enabling victim organizations to contact the actors 
through a live chat panel to discuss payment for their files. However, some victims reported receiving 
phone calls or emails from Hive actors directly to discuss payment. 
Page 2 of 12  |  Product ID: AA22-321A 
TLP: CLEAR 
TLP:CLEAR 
The ransom note also threatens victims that a public disclosure or leak site accessible on the TOR 
site, “HiveLeaks”, contains data exfiltrated from victim organizations who do not pay the ransom 
demand (see figure 1 below). Additionally, Hive actors have used anonymous file sharing sites to 
disclose exfiltrated data (see table 1 below).

Once the victim organization contacts Hive actors on the live chat panel, Hive actors communicate 
the ransom amount and the payment deadline. Hive actors negotiate ransom demands in U.S. 
dollars, with initial amounts ranging from several thousand to millions of dollars. Hive actors demand 
payment in Bitcoin. 
Hive actors have been known to reinfect—with either Hive ransomware or another ransomware 
variant—the networks of victim organizations who have restored their network without making a 
ransom payment. 
Indicators of Compromise 
Threat actors have leveraged the following IOCs during Hive ransomware compromises. Note: Some 
of these indicators are legitimate applications that Hive threat actors used to aid in further malicious 
exploitation. FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend removing any application not deemed necessary for 
day-to-day operations. See tables 2−3 below for IOCs obtained from FBI threat response 
investigations as recently as November 2022.

MITIGATIONS 
FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend organizations, particularly in the HPH sector, implement the 
following to limit potential adversarial use of common system and network discovery techniques and 
to reduce the risk of compromise by Hive ransomware: 
•  Verify Hive actors no longer have access to the network. 
• 
Install updates for operating systems, software, and firmware as soon as they are 
released. Prioritize patching VPN servers, remote access software, virtual machine software, 
and known exploited vulnerabilities. Consider leveraging a centralized patch management 
system to automate and expedite the process. 
•  Require phishing-resistant MFA for as many services as possible—particularly for webmail, 
VPNs, accounts that access critical systems, and privileged accounts that manage backups. 
If used, secure and monitor RDP. 
• 
o  Limit access to resources over internal networks, especially by restricting RDP and 
using virtual desktop infrastructure. 
o  After assessing risks, if you deem RDP operationally necessary, restrict the originating 
sources and require MFA to mitigate credential theft and reuse. 
If RDP must be available externally, use a VPN, virtual desktop infrastructure, or other 
means to authenticate and secure the connection before allowing RDP to connect to 
internal devices. 
o 
o  Monitor remote access/RDP logs, enforce account lockouts after a specified number of 
attempts to block brute force campaigns, log RDP login attempts, and disable unused 
remote access/RDP ports. 
o  Be sure to properly configure devices and enable security features. 
o  Disable ports and protocols not used for business purposes, such as RDP Port 
3389/TCP. 
•  Maintain offline backups of data, and regularly maintain backup and restoration.  By instituting 
this practice, the organization ensures they will not be severely interrupted, and/or only have 
irretrievable data. 
•  Ensure all backup data is encrypted, immutable (i.e., cannot be altered or deleted), and covers 
the entire organization’s data infrastructure. Ensure your backup data is not already infected. 
•  Monitor cyber threat reporting regarding the publication of compromised VPN login credentials 
and change passwords/settings if applicable. 
Page 8 of 12  |  Product ID: AA22-321A 
TLP: CLEAR 
TLP:CLEAR 
Install and regularly update anti-virus or anti-malware software on all hosts. 
• 
•  Enable PowerShell Logging including module logging, script block logging and transcription. 
• 
Install an enhanced monitoring tool such as Sysmon from Microsoft for increased logging. 
•  Review the following additional resources. 
o  The joint advisory from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States on Technical Approaches to Uncovering and Remediating Malicious 
Activity provides additional guidance when hunting or investigating a network and 
common mistakes to avoid in incident handling. 
o  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency-Multi-State Information Sharing 
& Analysis Center Joint Ransomware Guide covers additional best practices and ways 
to prevent, protect, and respond to a ransomware attack. 
o  StopRansomware.gov is the U.S. Government’s official one-stop location for resources 
to tackle ransomware more effectively. 
If your organization is impacted by a ransomware incident, FBI, CISA, and HHS recommend the 
following actions. 
• 
Isolate the infected system. Remove the infected system from all networks, and disable the 
computer’s wireless, Bluetooth, and any other potential networking capabilities. Ensure all 
shared and networked drives are disconnected. 
•  Turn off other computers and devices. Power-off and segregate (i.e., remove from the 
network) the infected computer(s). Power-off and segregate any other computers or devices 
that share a network with the infected computer(s) that have not been fully encrypted by 
ransomware. If possible, collect and secure all infected and potentially infected computers and 
devices in a central location, making sure to clearly label any computers that have been 
encrypted. Powering-off and segregating infected computers and computers that have not 
been fully encrypted may allow for the recovery of partially encrypted files by specialists. 
•  Secure your backups. Ensure that your backup data is offline and secure. If possible, scan 
your backup data with an antivirus program to check that it is free of malware. 
In addition, FBI, CISA, and HHS urge all organizations to apply the following recommendations to 
prepare for, mitigate/prevent, and respond to ransomware incidents. 
Preparing for Cyber Incidents 
•  Review the security posture of third-party vendors and those interconnected with your 
organization. Ensure all connections between third-party vendors and outside software or 
hardware are monitored and reviewed for suspicious activity. 
Implement listing policies for applications and remote access that only allow systems to 
execute known and permitted programs under an established security policy. 
• 
•  Document  and  monitor  external  remote  connections.  Organizations  should  document 
approved solutions for remote management and maintenance, and immediately investigate if 
an unapproved solution is installed on a workstation.

• 
Implement a recovery plan to maintain and retain multiple copies of sensitive or proprietary 
data and servers in a physically separate, segmented, and secure location (i.e., hard drive, 
storage device, the cloud). 
Identity and Access Management 
•  Require all accounts with password logins (e.g., service account, admin accounts, and 
domain admin accounts) to comply with National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) standards for developing and managing password policies. 
o  Use longer passwords consisting of at least 8 characters and no more than 64 
characters in length. 
o  Store passwords in hashed format using industry-recognized password managers. 
o  Add password user “salts” to shared login credentials. 
o  Avoid reusing passwords. 
o 
o  Disable password “hints.” 
o  Refrain from requiring password changes more frequently than once per year unless a

password is known or suspected to be compromised. 
Note: NIST guidance suggests favoring longer passwords instead of requiring regular 
and frequent password resets. Frequent password resets are more likely to result in 
users developing password “patterns” cyber criminals can easily decipher. 
o  Require administrator credentials to install software. 
•  Require phishing-resistant multifactor authentication for all services to the extent 
possible, particularly for webmail, virtual private networks, and accounts that access critical 
systems. 
•  Review domain controllers, servers, workstations, and active directories for new and/or 
unrecognized accounts. 
•  Audit user accounts with administrative privileges and configure access controls according 
• 
to the principle of least privilege. 
Implement time-based access for accounts set at the admin level and higher. For 
example, the Just-in-Time (JIT) access method provisions privileged access when needed 
and can support enforcement of the principle of least privilege (as well as the Zero Trust 
model). This is a process where a network-wide policy is set in place to automatically disable 
admin accounts at the Active Directory level when the account is not in direct need. Individual 
users may submit their requests through an automated process that grants them access to a 
specified system for a set timeframe when they need to support the completion of a certain 
task. 
Protective Controls and Architecture 
•  Segment networks to prevent the spread of ransomware. Network segmentation can help 
prevent the spread of ransomware by controlling traffic flows between—and access to— 
various subnetworks and by restricting adversary lateral movement.

TLP: CLEAR 
TLP:CLEAR 
• 
• 
Identify, detect, and investigate abnormal activity and potential traversal of the 
indicated ransomware with a networking monitoring tool. To aid in detecting the 
ransomware, implement a tool that logs and reports all network traffic, including lateral 
movement activity on a network. Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are particularly 
useful for detecting lateral connections as they have insight into common and uncommon 
network connections for each host. 
Install, regularly update, and enable real time detection for antivirus software on all 
hosts. 
Vulnerability and Configuration Management 
•  Consider adding an email banner to emails received from outside your organization. 
•  Disable command-line and scripting activities and permissions. Privilege escalation and 
lateral movement often depend on software utilities running from the command line. If threat 
actors are not able to run these tools, they will have difficulty escalating privileges and/or 
moving laterally. 
•  Ensure devices are properly configured and that security features are enabled. 
•  Restrict Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol within the network to only access 
necessary servers and remove or disable outdated versions of SMB (i.e., SMB version 
1). Threat actors use SMB to propagate malware across organizations.

INFORMATION REQUESTED 
The FBI, CISA, and HHS do not encourage paying a ransom to criminal actors. Paying a ransom may 
embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to engage in 
the distribution of ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities. Paying the ransom also does not 
guarantee that a victim’s files will be recovered. However, the FBI, CISA, and HHS understand that 
when businesses are faced with an inability to function, executives will evaluate all options to protect 
their shareholders, employees, and customers. Regardless of whether you or your organization 
decide to pay the ransom, the FBI, CISA, and HHS urge you to promptly report ransomware incidents 
to your local FBI field office, or to CISA at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. Doing so provides 
investigators with the critical information they need to track ransomware attackers, hold them 
accountable under US law, and prevent future attacks. 
The FBI may seek the following information that you determine you can legally share, including: 
•  Recovered executable files

Threat summary
Cisco Talos has identified a resurgence of activity by Tor2Mine, a cryptocurrency
mining group that was likely last active in 2018. Tor2Mine is deploying additional
malware to harvest credentials and steal more money, including AZORult, an
information-stealing malware; the remote access tool Remcos; the DarkVNC backdoor
trojan; and a clipboard cryptocurrency stealer.
The actors are also using a new IP address and two new domains to carry out their
operations.
The addition of new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) suggest Tor2Mine is
seeking ways to diversify their revenue in a volatile cryptocurrency market.
What’s new?
Tor2Mine has traditionally been a cryptocurrency mining malware actor notorious for
infecting victims with cryptominers that steal system resources to mine currency. In a new
development, the Tor2Mine actors have incorporated additional malware into their
operations, likely as a way to diversify revenue streams and stay relevant in a COVID-19
world where cryptocurrencies are fluctuating wildly.
So what?
Between January and June 2020, Cisco Talos observed resurgent activity from Tor2Mine, a
profit-driven actor that remains active despite a global economic recession and volatile
cryptocurrency market. To address these challenges, Tor2Mine, a group traditionally known
to deliver cryptocurrency mining malware, has begun using additional malware to harvest
victims’ credentials and steal more money. The addition of new TTPs, as well as the use of
1/8
new infrastructure, highlights Tor2Mine’s resilience in a challenging threat environment.
These developments also underscore threat actors’ persistence more broadly and should
serve as a reminder that organizations must maintain heightened security at all times.
What makes the Tor2Mine group notable is their use of Tor2web for command and control
(C2) for their malware infections. The Tor2web services act as a bridge between the internet
and the Tor network, a system that allows users to enable anonymous communication. These
services are useful for malware authors because they eliminate the need for malware to
communicate with the Tor network directly, which is suspicious and may be blocked, and
